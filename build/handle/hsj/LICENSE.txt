A. HANDLE.NET PUBLIC LICENSE AGREEMENT (Ver.1)

This Handle.Net Public License Agreement (ver.1) ("License Agreement")
is between Corporation for National Research Initiatives ("CNRI"),
having an office at 1895 Preston White Drive, Reston, VA 20191-5434,
and the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") that has accessed,
installed or otherwise used the software owned by CNRI called
HANDLE.NET® and its included documentation ("HDL Software")
(collectively the "Parties"). Licensee shall be deemed to have entered
into, signed and agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of
this License Agreement upon such access, installation or other use.

1.  License: Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
CNRI hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, royalty-free,
worldwide license to use, reproduce, distribute, perform and/or
display publicly, and prepare derivative works based on the HDL
Software, and to authorize others to do so, in source or binary form.
CNRI and Licensee acknowledge and agree that the HDL Software has not
been especially made or especially adapted to use in combination with
any particular software or product.  Accordingly, CNRI shall have no
liability for or in connection with Licensee's use of the HDL Software
in any such combination.

2.  Conditions of License: Any exercise of the rights granted herein
is subject to the following requirements:

  a. The HDL Software made available by CNRI to Licensee hereunder,
  and any software or other work that is based on or incorporates all
  or any part of the HDL Software, whether retained by Licensee, or
  made available to others, shall include CNRI's copyright notice and
  this Handle.Net Public License Agreement (ver.1) in the HDL Software
  itself at LICENSE.txt or in any derivative version thereof prepared
  by Licensee. The grant of these rights is further conditioned on
  Licensee's agreement to require every sub-licensee or other person
  or entity ("Other Party") authorized to exercise any of the rights
  granted herein to include CNRI's copyright notice and this License
  Agreement in similar fashion in any version of the HDL Software,
  modified or unmodified, that is used, reproduced, distributed,
  performed and/or displayed publicly, or adapted by such Other Party
  or by any licensee of such Other Party.

  b. Licensee hereby acknowledges that CNRI has included specific
  third-party software with the HDL Software ("third-party
  software"). Licensee hereby acknowledges and agrees that this
  License Agreement conveys no right, title or interest to Licensee by
  CNRI in any such third-party software and that it is Licensee's sole
  obligation to comply with all conditions of the licenses covering
  use of such third-party software. A list of the third-party software
  license agreements is included in the HDL Software at LICENSE.txt
  and should be retained therein when the HDL Software is used alone,
  or in any derivative version prepared by Licensee.

  c. Licensee may not exercise any of the rights granted herein for or
  in connection with the establishment or operation by Licensee alone,
  or in cooperation with any other person, of a system of identifier
  and/or resolution services that disrupts the integrity of the
  Handle.Net Registry or the Global Handle Registry ("GHR") in any
  manner.

  d. In the event that Licensee alone, or in cooperation with any
  other party, wishes to provide identifier and/or resolution services
  that use or are based on the HDL Software ("Services"), and, unless
  otherwise agreed to in writing between the Parties, then as a
  material condition of this License Agreement, Licensee must enter
  into and maintain in effect a Service Agreement with CNRI for
  authorization to provide such Services and be allotted a prefix for
  this purpose. Licensee should visit CNRI's Handle.Net Registry
  website at: http://handle.net for information on how to enter into a
  Service Agreement and obtain a prefix. Alternatively, Licensee may
  enter into a service agreement and obtain a prefix from an
  organization other than CNRI that has been authorized and
  credentialed by the DONA Foundation to provide GHR Services; and
  information on such organizations is available at the DONA
  Foundation website at: http://dona.net.

  e. If Licensee institutes litigation against any entity (including a
  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the HDL
  Software infringes Licensee's proprietary rights, then this License
  Agreement and any license granted hereunder, shall automatically
  terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

3.  Updates to HDL Software: CNRI, at its sole discretion, may provide
updates to the HDL Software, and CNRI will post any such updates at:
http://handle.net. With respect to such updates to the HDL Software,
it is Licensee's sole responsibility to install such updates promptly.

4.  Trademarks: Handle.Net, Hdl.Net and CNRI are trademarks of CNRI;
and Global Handle Registry is a trademark of the DONA Foundation
("Trademarks"). The Trademarks may not be used in a trademark sense or
to endorse or promote any software, services or products of Licensee,
or any third party.

5.  Disclaimer of Warranties: CNRI IS PROVIDING THE HDL SOFTWARE ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS. CNRI EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND EXCLUDES ALL WARRANTIES,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF
SATISFACTORY QUALITY, AND OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
USE. CNRI MAKES NO REPRESENTATION AND DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY THAT THE
HDL SOFTWARE, AND ANY MODIFICATIONS OR ENHANCEMENTS THEREOF OR
DERIVATIVE WORKS BASED THEREON, WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY PATENT,
COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, TRADE SECRET OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHT.

6.  Limitation on Liability: CNRI WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR
THIRD PARTIES FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR
SERVICES, LOSS OF USER DATA OR PROFITS, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION,
HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE AND INFRINGEMENT OR
MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS), PRODUCT LIABILITY
OR OTHERWISE, BASED ON OR ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE PERFORMANCE OF
THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS HANDLE.NET PUBLIC
LICENSE AGREEMENT, EVEN IF CNRI IS ADVISED OR IS OTHERWISE AWARE OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.  License Agreement Versions: CNRI may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Handle.Net Public License Agreement from time to time.
Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.  Once HDL
Software has been made available under a particular version, Licensee
may continue to use it under the terms of that version.  No one other
than CNRI has the right to modify the terms of the License Agreement.

8.  Export Restrictions: The HDL Software provided to Licensee under
this License Agreement, and any updates to the HDL Software, may be
subject to export or import laws and/or regulations in the United
States and in other countries. Licensee agrees to comply with such
laws and regulations and shall be responsible for obtaining any and
all required export and import documentation.

9.  Termination: This License Agreement may be terminated, at CNRI's
sole discretion, upon a material breach of its terms and conditions by
Licensee.

10.  General: To the extent United States Federal law is not
applicable, this License Agreement shall be governed by and
interpreted in all respects in accordance with the law of the
Commonwealth of Virginia, excluding Virginia conflict of law
provisions, and the courts within such State shall be the only courts
of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be
deemed to create any relationship of agency, partnership, or joint
venture between CNRI and Licensee.
